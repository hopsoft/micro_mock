# MicroMock is a tiny mocking script.
#
# It doesn't make any assumptions about the testing framework
# and leaves assertions/expectations up to you.
#
# Calling it a mocking script is a bit of a misnomer
# since its really a dynamic class generator.
#
# The term "stub" is used loosely since it adds real behavior...
# and "mocking" a class with real behavior proves to be quite useful.
#
# @example
#   Mock = MicroMock.make
#
#   # mock a class method
#   Mock.stub(:foo) { :bar }
#
#   # make assertions
#   assert_equal :bar, Mock.foo # Test::Unit
#   Mock.foo.should eq :bar # RSpec
#
#   # mock an instance method
#   m = Mock.new
#   m.stub(:bar) { :foo }
#
#   # make assertions
#   assert_equal :foo, m.bar # Test::Unit
#   m.bar.should eq :foo # RSpec
#
#   # setup mock internal behavior
#   count = 1
#   m.stub(:a) { count += 1 }
#   m.stub(:b) { |i| self.a if i > 5 }
#
#   # make assertions
#   10.times { |i| m.b(i) }
#   assert_equal 5, count # Test::Unit
#   count.should eq 5 # RSpec
#
